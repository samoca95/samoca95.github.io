Two-point spatial correlation of two variables (also called two-point cross-correlation) is a procedure usually applied to investigate the spatial relation between two variables, respectively, at two spatial points in a turbulence field. Two-point cross-correlation coefficient of two variables $\phi_i$ and $\psi_i$ is defined for two locations as:
$$R_{ij}(x_r,x)=\frac{\langle \phi_i(x_r) \psi_j(x) \rangle}{\sqrt{\langle \phi^2_i(x_r) \rangle} \sqrt{\langle \psi^2_j(x) \rangle}}$$
where the subscription $r$ denotes the reference point; $\phi$ and $\psi$ are fluctuations of two variables or components, e.g. velocity, vorticity, temperature, pressure, shear stress. Here, the numbered indices, $i$ and $j$ $(i,j=1,2,3)$, respectively indicate the streamwise (x-direction), wall normal (y-direction) and spanwise (z-direction) directions, and $\langle \cdot \rangle$ denotes an ensemble average of realizations.
