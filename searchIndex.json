		"content": "Two-point spatial correlation of two variables (also called two-point cross-correlation) is a procedure usually applied to investigate the spatial relation between two variables, respectively, at two spatial points in a turbulence field. Two-point cross-correlation coefficient of two variables ϕi and ψi is defined for two locations as:\nRij(xr,x)=⟨ϕi(xr)ψj(x)⟩⟨ϕi2(xr)⟩⟨ψj2(x)⟩where the subscription r denotes the reference point; ϕ and ψ are fluctuations of two variables or components, e.g. velocity, vorticity, temperature, pressure, shear stress. Here, the numbered indices, i and j (i,j=1,2,3), respectively indicate the streamwise (x-direction), wall normal (y-direction) and spanwise (z-direction) directions, and ⟨⋅⟩ denotes an ensemble average of realizations.",
